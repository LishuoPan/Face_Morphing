# Face_Morphing

1. Run the main_script.py will activate the whole program. And you should add the points to the images, currently I add 8 initial points in the code: left_up, right_up, left_down, right_down, up_mid, left_mid, right_mid and down_mid


2. The input images are in the "source_imgs" folder. The two input images are named as source and target. The file type is .jpg

3.The output file is output.gif
Currently I save two .gif files:
output_person.gif(mandatory one)
output_cat.gif
output_cup.gif
